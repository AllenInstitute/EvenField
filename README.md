# EvenField - An easy, cost effective alternative to commercial based illumination systems for fluorescence microscopy
----------------------------

For decades, coherent laser sources with Gaussian output profiles have been a preferred choice in many optical microscopy systems due to their high spatial intensity and monochromaticity. While these traits can beneficial in many applications, the high spatial coherence of these lasers results in interference effects as the light propogates toward the sample plane. These inference patterns superimposed onto the Gaussian laser profile result in an uneven illumination of the sample. that get transferred into resulting images. For applications such as single molecule fluorescence imaging, the resulting inhomogeneity 

In addition, when these sources are used for imaging large areas that require tiling of multiple fields of view
