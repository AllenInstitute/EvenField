### Output Collimator:
	  1 x Edmund Optics 88-379, 10X Objective, Nikon CFI Plan Fluor
	   OR
	  1 x Thorlabs PAF2P-18A, FiberPort, FC/PC, f=18.4 mm, 350 - 700 nm, Ø3.01 mm Waist
		       Note: Mitsubishi MM fiber has a very large fiber core (600 µm x 600 µm). Due to its size, using the 10X Objective          
                       is the preferred collimation option to avoid vignetting; however, this option introduces additional optical 
                       alignment complexities. 

### Zoom illuminator:

The following parts form a critical illumiator to couple an output fiber into a square prism, then project the prism exit face to the sample plane.  The following components were used in combination with a Nikon Ti2 and Iris15 camera.  The zoom lens adjustments allow for straightforward matching of the illumination and collection areas with minimal light outside of this region.  Using the square prism avoids the need for a square-core fiber and additional magnification in this application.
